## 😃  Hey there! I'm Nadim Chatellier!
💻  Junior Software Engineer | Code Enthusiast | Tech Tinkerer | Lover of all things nerdy

I just recently graduated from NorthCoders! Now its time to take these skills into the world of software development and show what I am made of!

### 🔭 I’m currently working on...
- Building a unit manager for Warhammer 40k, because if Games Workshop won't do it, *I* will. React and Node.js are my weapons of choice for making army management as easy as rolling dice.
- Improving [GameSwap](https://game-swap.netlify.app)! There are still plenty of features to implement. Check out the current version here.
