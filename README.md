## ðŸ˜ƒ  Hey there! I'm Nadim Chatellier!

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...
- Building a unit manager for Warhammer 40k, because if Games Workshop won't do it, *I* will. React and Node.js are my weapons of choice for making army management as easy as rolling dice.
- Improving GameSwap! There is still so many improvements that can be made!

### âš¡ Fun fact:
- I once built a game using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for fun. It turned out to be a lot more challenging than I expected, but I loved every minute of it!
