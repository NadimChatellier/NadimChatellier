## ðŸ˜ƒ  Hey there! I'm Nadim Chatellier!
ðŸ’»  Junior Software Engineer | Code Enthusiast | Tech Tinkerer | Lover of all things nerdy

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...
- Building a unit manager for Warhammer 40k, because if Games Workshop won't do it, *I* will. React and Node.js are my weapons of choice for making army management as easy as rolling dice.
- Improving GameSwap! There is still so many improvements that can be made! Check out where it's at now: (game-swap.netlify.app)
